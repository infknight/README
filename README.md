Welcome to Zixuan Jia's Github. 
I am a sophomore at Texas A&M University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business. I have learned various computer concepts and languages in my college experiences. With two years of experience in C++, one-year experience in Python, learning various data structures and algorithms, and materials I have learned from coding and cyber club, I believe I could qualified for a computer science related internship. I not only maintain my high GPA at school, but I also participate in different organizations at Texas A&M University.
